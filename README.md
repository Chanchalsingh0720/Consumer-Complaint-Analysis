# Consumer Complaints Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of consumer complaints data to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide actionable insights. The dataset includes information about complaint types, resolution times, response times, and other related metrics.

## Data Description

The project uses Excel data with the following key sheets:

- **Complaints Data**: Contains complaint records categorized by year, issue type, resolution time, response times, and complaint channels.
- **Products**: Contains information on different financial products and their associated complaints.
- **Channels**: Contains data on the channels through which complaints were filed.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Number of Complaints**:
   - Provides the total number of complaints each year and the YoY change in the number of complaints.

2. **Number of Complaints with Timely Response**:
   - Shows the number of complaints for which timely responses were provided, along with YoY changes.

3. **Average Resolution Time**:
   - Displays the average resolution time for complaints and the YoY change in resolution times.

4. **Proportion of Complaints by Product**:
   - Analyzes the proportion of complaints related to different financial products.

5. **Proportion of Complaints by Channel**:
   - Examines the proportion of complaints filed through various channels.

6. **Monthly Trend of Complaints**:
   - Tracks the monthly trend of the number of complaints.
